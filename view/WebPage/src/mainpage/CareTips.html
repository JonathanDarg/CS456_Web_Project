        When rescueing a dog, it is important to be patient and understanding as
        they adjust to their new home. Many rescue dogs come from difficult or
        unknown backgrounds, so they may need time to build trust and feel safe.
        Creating a calm environment, establishing routines, and providing gentle
        training can help them settle in. Regular veterinary care, proper
        nutrition, and lots of positive attention will support both their
        physical and emotional recovery as they transitio into a loving,
        permanent home.
        <br />
        Here are some tips on how you can do that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Give your dog time to adjust to their new surroundings.</li>
        <li>Schedule a veterinary checkup soon after the adoption.</li>
        <li>Provide a quiet, safe space where they can relax.</li>
        <li>Establish consistent feeding, walking, and sleeping routines.</li>
        <li>Use positive reinforcement when training.</li>
        <li>Be patient with behavioral or anxiety-related issues.</li>
      </ul>
